    "### Project Charter\n",
    "The intent of the project is to predict the future state of current loans as **Fully Paid or Default**. This is supposed to be achieved through training the classification algorithms on labeled data (Fully Paid & Default) and then making predictions on the dataset which contains current loans. This exercise is being done for Finance & Risk teams at Lending Club to accurately identify the end state of a loan, thus helping them with accurate revenue forecasting and risk mitigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "[Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data) used for the project, this file contain complete loan data for all loans issued through the 2007-2015, including the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) and latest payment information. The file containing loan data through the \"present\" contains complete loan data for all loans issued through the previous completed calendar quarter. Additional features include credit scores, number of finance inquiries, address including zip codes, and state, and collections among others. The file is a matrix of about 890 thousand observations and 75 variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Wrangling\n",
    "To begin with data was structured and available in a delimited file, thus initial consumption of data was straightforward. Based on EDA, there was a need to transform existing data into a format more conducive for modelling. Following attributes were derived from one or more than one attribute,\n",
    "- loan_status_bin, to condense related loan statuses into a single category\n",
    "- replace absent annual income with median annual income\n",
    "- derive numerical credit_grade from textual value\n",
    "- derive derived_income from a combination of application type, annual  income, and joint annual income\n",
    "- derive derived_dti from a combiation of application type, dti, and joint dti\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "Exploratory data analysis was performed to identify correlation of various customer and loan attributes with the status of the loan; and also to identify the strength of relationship between various customer and loan attributes to develop an understanding of Lending Club customers, their reasons for taking out loan, and the type of loan they take out.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Inferential Statistics\n",
    "As part of inferential statistics I evaluated my hypothesis about signal strength between annual income and loan status (_Fully Paid or Default_)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Engineering\n",
    "Since all the features do not impact the outcome of the loan, neither do they impact the outcome of the loan equally, I worked on selecting a subset of features which correlated most strongly with the status of the loan, and used them in training the classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Selection\n",
    "I started with a naive Logistic Classifier, then slowly worked my way through the models with increasing complexity, Logistic Classifier with C, CART, Random Forest, XGBoost and captured their performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Evaluation\n",
    "I compared the performance metrics of above models to select the best models to tune their hyper parameters to increase their accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Imabalance/ Resampling\n",
    "While looking at the Classification reports, I realized that there is a sever class imabalance between Default (x) and Fully Paid (10x) and thus models were better at learning features for Fully Paid loans, to overcome this challenge I used[SMOTE](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume16/chawla02a-html/chawla2002.html) to resample data to equalize sample size in **training data**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hyper Parameter Tuning\n",
    "I employed techiniques such as RandomSearhCV & GridSearchCV to find the most optimal set of heyper parameters for multiple models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Client Recommendations\n",
    "1. More training data especially for Default samples\n",
    "2. Deploy the best current model in production as a pilot and evaluate in live environment.\n",
    "3. Restructure the problem as a regression problem and rate the outcome of a loan on scale of 0 to 1 rather than a binary outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Work\n",
    "1. Gather more training data\n",
    "2. Try ensembling/ stacking of models.\n",
    "3. Try [deep learning techniques for tabular data](http://www.fast.ai/2018/04/29/categorical-embeddings/)\n"
